I approached [this week's Riddler](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/cubs-world-series-puzzles-for-fun-and-profit/) by building a decision tree from the bottom up.  Let's start with the easiest case: betting on game 7.  At this point, we must be net-even in betting, and we must wager $100 on the Cubs to win.  Knowing this, we can extrapolate how we need to bet on the 2-3 and 3-2 games.  In the 3-2 game, we need to have won $50 thus far, and we need to wager $50 on the Cubs to win.  If the Cubs do win, we will have won $100.  If the Cubs lose, then we'll be back to even, and we'll be in the aforementioned game 7 scenario.  Working backward, we can deduce how we must bet in each of the 16 possible scenarios.  Interestingly, we will bet $31.25 on the first and second games no matter what.
